## About

Genetic AI was a lab in my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class that demonstrated how AI can solve problems by learning from its mistakes.

## Context

This python-based genetic AI algorithm aims to produce a fitness level of 32, which indicates that all the bits in a single offspring are 1. The code output shows that for every generation, the AI uses probability and luck to achieve its end goal of producing one offspring with all bits set to 1.
